# CP1404 2018 SP53 Assignment 1
Assignment 1 for CP1404, 2018 SP53, IT@JCU

Edit this README file, replacing this paragraph with your own assignment details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the `answer...` parts).  
Note: If you use the free WakaTime service on your own machine, you can track exactly how long you spent in code. See https://trello.com/c/6H24THnj/21-wakatime-time-tracking-for-ides-join-our-leaderboard

1. How long did the entire project (assignment 1) take you?
> The entirety of assignment 1 took me a total of 4 days to complete. I spent th majority of the first day trying to understand the assignment properly before starting on making the list of the program, which proved to be a challenge so I stopped there for the first day. On the second day, I was able to complete the list() function successfully and moved on to the add() function, which proved to be very difficult and stalled me for another day. On the third day, I managed to finish the add() function and moved on to the final function which is the complete() function. On the final day, after completing and error checking all of my work, i made final adjustments and tweaks to the program before its official completiton.  


2. What do you plan to do  differently in your development process for assignment 2?
> I plan to getting an earlier head start on reading the assingment before actually doing it as I felt like I rushed into trying to understanding assignment 1 right away and that could have proved to be the reason why i intitally struggled so much trying to understand what I was supposed to and was trying to do.
